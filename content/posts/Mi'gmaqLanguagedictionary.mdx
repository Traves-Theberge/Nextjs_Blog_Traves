### My Journey into Learning Programming with JavaScript and Node.js

#### The Beginning: A Passion for Technology and Language

My journey into programming started with a deep-rooted passion for technology and a desire to make a meaningful impact. As a Canadian Indigenous professional, I’ve always been passionate about preserving and revitalizing Indigenous languages, particularly the Mi'gmaq language. This passion led me to embark on my first-ever project, the Mi'gmaq Foundation, which was a pivotal moment in my journey as it taught me about structuring data and organizing educational content.

The Mi'gmaq Foundation project wasn’t just a technical endeavor; it was a mission to create a platform that could support language preservation through games, lessons, and resources. It was the foundation that sparked my interest in programming and set the stage for everything that followed.

#### Diving into JavaScript, Node.js, Openai and PostgreSQL

As I delved deeper into programming, I realized that to bring my ideas to life, I needed to learn a programming language and tools that were both versatile and widely used. JavaScript became the natural choice for building interactive and dynamic web applications. Discovering Node.js allowed me to extend JavaScript to the server-side, enabling full-stack application development.

In building the Mi'gmaq Dictionary framework, I integrated JavaScript and Node.js with Supabase and PostgreSQL. Supabase provided a powerful backend solution, and PostgreSQL offered robust database management. Together, these tools allowed me to create a dictionary with advanced search functions and AI-powered features.

One of the key features of this project was the AI integration, which could provide users with interesting facts about the Mi'gmaq language using prompting techniques. This combination of technologies not only made the dictionary functional but also engaging and informative for users.

#### Challenges and Growth

The journey hasn’t been without challenges. There were times when I felt overwhelmed by the complexity of certain concepts or frustrated when something didn’t work as expected. But each challenge was an opportunity to learn and grow. Whether it was debugging a stubborn piece of code or figuring out how to optimize performance, every obstacle made me a better programmer.

One of the key lessons I’ve learned is the importance of persistence. Programming is a field where you’re constantly learning, and it’s easy to feel like you’re not making progress. But every line of code you write, every bug you fix, and every project you complete brings you one step closer to mastering the craft.

#### Looking Ahead: Continuing the Journey

Today, I’m more passionate about programming than ever. I’ve seen firsthand how powerful technology can be in making a positive impact, and I’m excited to continue exploring what I can create. I’m currently working on projects that involve integrating AI, creating more advanced tools for education, and exploring the possibilities of web development with frameworks like Next.js.

The journey is far from over, and I’m looking forward to where it will take me next. As I continue to learn and grow, I hope to inspire others to start their own journey into programming—because if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that the possibilities are truly endless when you combine passion with technology.

#### Conclusion

Learning programming with JavaScript, Node.js, Supabase, and PostgreSQL has been a transformative experience for me. It’s not just about writing code; it’s about solving problems, creating tools, and making a difference. I’m grateful for the journey so far and excited about the future projects and challenges that await.

If you’re just starting your own programming journey, my advice is simple: start building. There’s no better way to learn than by doing, and with every project, you’ll gain the skills and confidence needed to take on even bigger challenges.
