Introduction: The Vision for a Modern Chat Experience

In the age of artificial intelligence, chat applications are evolving to provide more than just basic messaging. They are becoming intelligent, feature-rich platforms that can adapt to various user needs. I embarked on a project to build a Next.js-based chat application that leverages AI capabilities, offering users a dynamic and responsive chat experience. This application is designed not only to facilitate real-time communication but also to integrate powerful AI models, making conversations more interactive and informative.

#### Key Features of the Chat Application

1\. User Authentication with Supabase

One of the core features of the application is user authentication. Using Supabase, I implemented signup, login, and logout functionality, ensuring that users can securely access the chat platform. Supabase provides a seamless authentication flow, with support for managing user sessions, password recovery, and more.

* Signup, Login, Logout: Users can create accounts, sign in securely, and log out when needed.
* Supabase Integration: Handles authentication, user management, and session tracking.

2\. AI-Powered Chat with Multiple Models

The heart of the chat application lies in its AI-powered messaging capabilities. Users can engage in real-time conversations with AI models, making the chat experience not just interactive but also intelligent. The application supports multiple AI models, allowing users to choose between OpenAI models like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo, or Mistral AI models, depending on their needs.

* Real-time Messaging: Instant responses powered by AI.
* Multiple AI Models: Flexibility to choose the best AI model for each conversation.

3\. Model Selection: OpenAI and Mistral AI

To provide users with a tailored chat experience, the application includes a feature for model selection. Users can switch between different AI models, such as OpenAI’s GPT series or Mistral AI, depending on the complexity or style of responses they require.

* Model Switching: Dynamically change the AI model during a conversation.
* Customization: Adapt the chat experience to different use cases.

4\. Chat Management: Session Control

Managing chat sessions is crucial for any chat application. This application allows users to create new chat sessions, revisit previous conversations, and delete sessions they no longer need. This ensures that users have full control over their chat history and can manage their conversations efficiently.

* Create, Read, Delete Sessions: Full control over chat session management.
* Session History: Access past conversations for reference.

5\. Responsive Design with Collapsible Sidebar

In today’s mobile-first world, responsive design is essential. The chat application features a collapsible sidebar that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

* Responsive UI: Optimized for mobile and desktop users.
* Collapsible Sidebar: Enhanced usability on smaller screens.

6\. Markdown Support with Code Syntax Highlighting

To make conversations more expressive and informative, the chat application supports Markdown in messages. This includes rendering of text formatting, lists, links, and more. Additionally, code snippets can be highlighted with syntax highlighting, making it easier to share and review code within the chat.

* Markdown Rendering: Rich text formatting in chat messages.
* Code Syntax Highlighting: Enhanced readability for shared code.

7\. File Upload: Enhancing Conversations with Attachments

Sometimes, a conversation requires more than just text. The application includes a file upload feature, allowing users to attach files to their messages. This is particularly useful for sharing documents, images, or any other files relevant to the conversation.

* File Attachments: Add context to conversations with file uploads.
* Secure Storage: Manage files within the chat sessions securely.

8\. Emoji Picker for Expressive Conversations

To make conversations more engaging and fun, the chat application integrates an emoji picker. Users can easily add emojis to their messages, adding a layer of emotion and personality to their interactions.

* Emoji Integration: Enhance messages with a wide range of emojis.
* User-Friendly Picker: Easy-to-use interface for selecting emojis.

9\. Prompt Templating: Streamlining AI Interactions

To make AI interactions more efficient, the application includes a prompt templating feature. This allows users to quickly select predefined prompts or templates, streamlining the process of generating AI responses. It’s particularly useful for repetitive tasks or commonly asked questions.

* Prompt Templates: Predefined prompts for quick responses.
* Efficiency: Save time and ensure consistency in AI interactions.

#### The Development Process

1\. Setting Up Next.js and Supabase

The project began with setting up a Next.js environment, followed by integrating Supabase for user authentication. Next.js’s server-side rendering capabilities, combined with Supabase’s real-time database and authentication services, provided a solid foundation for the application.

2\. Implementing AI Models with OpenAI and Mistral AI

Integrating AI models was a critical step. By using the OpenAI API and integrating support for Mistral AI, I enabled the application to provide intelligent, context-aware responses. The flexibility to switch between models was implemented to give users more control over their chat experience.

3\. Building the User Interface with TailwindCSS

The user interface was designed with TailwindCSS, focusing on simplicity, responsiveness, and user experience. Tailwind’s utility-first approach allowed for rapid development and easy customization, ensuring that the chat application was both functional and visually appealing.

5\. Enhancing User Experience with Markdown, File Uploads, and Emojis

To make the chat experience more robust, I added support for Markdown, file uploads, and emojis. These features were implemented to make conversations richer and more expressive, catering to the diverse needs of users.

6\. Finalizing with Prompt Templating and Chat Management

Finally, the prompt templating and chat management features were added to streamline the AI interaction process and give users complete control over their chat sessions. This final step ensured that the application was not only powerful but also user-friendly.![](</uploads/Chat_ui_prompt templates.png>)

#### Conclusion: A Versatile and Intelligent Chat Platform

The Next.js-based chat application is more than just a messaging platform; it’s a versatile tool that combines real-time communication with the power of AI. With features like model selection, Markdown support, file uploads, and more, it offers a rich and engaging user experience.

As AI continues to evolve, I’m excited to explore new possibilities and enhance the application further. Whether you’re looking to build your own AI-powered chat application or simply interested in the latest web development technologies, this project serves as a testament to what’s possible when you combine modern frameworks with innovative ideas.

If you’re interested in building similar projects or want to learn more about the technologies used, I encourage you to dive in and start experimenting. The potential is limitless, and the journey is incredibly rewarding.
