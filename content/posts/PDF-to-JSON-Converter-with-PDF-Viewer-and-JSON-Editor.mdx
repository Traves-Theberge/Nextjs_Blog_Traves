## Building a PDF to JSON Converter with Integrated PDF Viewer and JSON Editor

In today's data-driven world, converting documents into structured formats like JSON is a common requirement for many developers. To address this need, I’ve developed a web application that streamlines the process of converting PDF files into JSON format. This application allows users to upload a PDF, view its content, convert it to JSON, edit the resulting JSON, and preview the output—all within a seamless interface.

### Key Features

This project comes with a set of powerful features designed to make PDF to JSON conversion as straightforward as possible:

* PDF Upload: Users can upload a PDF file through an intuitive file input, making it easy to get started.
* PDF Viewer: The application includes a built-in PDF viewer that displays the content of the uploaded PDF using the @react-pdf-viewer/core library.
* Conversion to JSON: With a single click, users can convert the PDF content into a structured JSON format, capturing the document’s textual and structural elements.
* JSON Editor: The converted JSON is displayed in an interactive code editor, allowing users to make adjustments or corrections to the JSON data.
* JSON Preview: A formatted preview of the JSON content is available, making it easier to understand the structure and data extracted from the PDF.
* Progress Indicator: The application includes a progress bar that shows the conversion status, ensuring users are informed throughout the process.
* File Operations: Users can save the JSON content to a file, clear the editor to start over, or reset the entire application to upload a new PDF.

### Core Components

The application is built using modular components, each handling a specific part of the functionality:

* FileUploader.js: This component handles user input for PDF file selection and reads the file content.
* PdfViewer.js: It renders the uploaded PDF file, providing an interactive viewer experience.
* JsonEditor.js: A code editor component that allows users to modify the JSON content, with syntax highlighting and other helpful features.
* JsonPreview\.js: This component displays the JSON content in a formatted view, making it easier to review and verify.
* ProgressBar.js: A visual progress bar that shows the conversion process in real-time.
* pdfToJsonConverter.js: The core logic for extracting text from the PDF, classifying elements, and generating the JSON structure is encapsulated in this file.
* \_app.js: The entry point for the Next.js application, responsible for setting up global styles and components.
* index.js: The main page component that integrates all other components and manages the overall application state.

### How It Works

The application is designed to be user-friendly while providing powerful functionality under the hood:

1. Upload a PDF: Users start by uploading a PDF file using the file input provided.
2. View and Convert: The PDF content is immediately viewable, and users can initiate the conversion to JSON with a single click.
3. Edit JSON: Once converted, the JSON content appears in an interactive editor where users can make any necessary edits.
4. Preview JSON: A formatted preview of the JSON is available to ensure accuracy before saving.
5. Save and Reset: Users can save the edited JSON to a file or reset the application to start over with a new PDF.

### Conclusion

This PDF to JSON converter offers a comprehensive solution for anyone needing to transform PDF content into structured JSON data. With its integrated PDF viewer, JSON editor, and user-friendly interface, it’s a valuable tool for developers and data analysts alike.
